##### A simple javascript weather web app reflecting the front end work I would do at OnShift before ECMAScript 2015

built with the Backbone framework using RequireJS AMD,  
styled with LESS and Bootstrap within the SUITCSS mindset,  
charted with D3 and templated with Handlebars,  
convenienced by underscore and jquery,  
tested with Karma, Mocha, Chai, and Sinon,  
tooled with npm, Bower, and Grunt with help from  
JSHint, JSCS, Uglify, Autoprefixer, CSScomb,  
CSSLint, CSSMin, Clean-css, Connect, and more.
